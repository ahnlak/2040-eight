2040-eight
==========

A puzzle game for the RP2040-based PicoSystem.

This game is released under the MIT License; see LICENSE for details.

The image assets need to be converted into suitable structures for the 
PicoSystem SDK - there are scripts in `bin/` for this purpose:

* `png2argb.py` converts a PNG file into buffer than can be used to blit from
* `png2bits.py` converts a PNG file into a single bit image, which is used
  for our fancy(?!) splash screen.

Share and Enjoy.
